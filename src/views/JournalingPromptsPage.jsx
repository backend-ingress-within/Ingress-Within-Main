      question: "What are journaling prompts?",
      answer: "Journaling prompts are focused questions or reflective cues designed to give you a clear starting point for your writing, helping you move past blank-page hesitation and explore specific thoughts, emotions, or experiences."
    },
    {
      question: "How do journaling prompts help with self-discovery?",
      answer: "Prompts direct your attention toward areas of your life you might otherwise overlook. By answering specific, open-ended questions, you can observe your reactions, clarify your values, and notice recurring themes in your thoughts."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I use journaling prompts?",
      answer: "There is no rigid rule. Many people find value in using one prompt daily during a regular reflection practice, while others use prompts whenever they feel stuck, encounter a challenging situation, or want to explore a specific theme."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I write if I do not know how to answer a prompt?",
      answer: "You can write honestly about your hesitation itself. Describing why a question feels difficult, vague, or uncomfortable is often just as revealing as having an immediate, polished answer."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the same journaling prompt more than once?",
      answer: "Yes. Returning to the same prompt weeks or months later allows you to compare your responses across time, revealing how your perspectives, priorities, and emotional responses evolve."
    },
    {
      question: "Is journaling the same as therapy?",
      answer: "No. Ingress Within is designed for guided self-reflection and self-understanding and is not a replacement for professional mental health care."

            Journaling prompts for self-discovery are focused questions designed to initiate honest self-observation. When you open a blank journal, it is easy to default to surface-level summaries of your day or feel uncertain about where to begin. Prompts act as entry points into deeper reflection.
