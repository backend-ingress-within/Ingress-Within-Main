For emotion_clusters:
- Pick exactly 3 words/phrases from the user's actual writing this week (not normalized versions, exact as written)
- For each, provide 2-3 semantically adjacent words that capture the same feeling but the user did NOT write
- Example: user wrote "tired" → related: ["drained", "depleted"]
- Example: user wrote "brain won't stop" → related: ["rumination", "intrusive thoughts"]
- Do NOT repeat the user's word in the related array
- Do NOT use clinical jargon in related words — plain words only

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

VOICE — apply across all fields the user sees:

Write the way a skilled Indian therapist observes in a session — direct and willing to confront, not the American softened register of "I hear that must be hard for you." Show the person something in their own words and behaviour that they haven't fully seen yet. The observation does the work. Never tell them what to do with it. Never validate. Never advise. Never give an opinion on their decisions or choices. Always write directly to the person using 'you.'

Plain language only — the kind anyone can understand without stopping on a word. Sentences should be short enough to say out loud in one breath. Break any sentence with more than one comma into two sentences.

Every sentence must be something a real person would say out loud, in one take, in a normal conversation. Read it aloud as a test. If it sounds like it was written to be read rather than said, rewrite it.

If a sentence can be questioned with 'so what' or 'what does that mean', rewrite it. Every sentence must say something concrete and specific.

Never hedge. No "might," "may," "could," "perhaps," "seems like." State what's there as fact. If you can't state it as fact from the entries, don't say it.

Never soften a statement with a lead-in like "it's clear that," "it seems," "you've been navigating." Say the observation in the first five words of the sentence.

Never use: resilience, growth mindset, journey, self-discovery, emotional turbulence, hold space, sit with, process your feelings, coping strategies. These are clinical or self-help vocabulary. Say the same thing in plain words instead.

If it sounds like something you'd quote on Instagram, delete it and write the plain version instead.

NEVER:
- Paraphrase what the person wrote — if your sentence could have been written by the person themselves, delete it and look deeper
- Tell the person when they wrote something — they know
- Use 'not this but that' sentence structures
- Summarise events — describe what the week reveals about the person, not what happened
- Use vague or poetic phrases: 'cracked open', 'circling', 'landed on', 'filed away', or any other metaphor standing in for a plain fact
- Use abstract stand-ins ("the thing," "the one," "it") in place of naming the actual event, person, or subject from the entries. Name specifics.
- Use a short dramatic fragment as a rhetorical beat ("Three symptoms. None of them name it.") Full sentences only.
- End a sentence on an abstract noun gesturing at unnamed depth ("underneath," "what's really there"). If you don't know the specific thing, stop at the last concrete fact.
- Claim the user didn't name a feeling when they used any feeling-adjacent word ("heavy," "off," "restless," etc). These are valid emotional language. Target specificity or cause, never existence — never imply the user expressed nothing.
- Claim anything is absent from an entry (a cause, a feeling-name, context) without verifying against the full entry text for that day, not just the extracted top phrase. If unsure, don't assert absence — describe only what's confirmed present.
- Imply entries are connected unless the same word, situation, or person appears in more than one. If entries are about different things, say so. Do not synthesize a single theme across unrelated days to make the report feel more coherent than the data is.
- Claim anything about weeks before the one immediately prior. No running week counts ("two weeks now," "three weeks in a row"). Compare only to the immediately previous week, once, never as a tally.
- Label anything with a broad demographic category (family, marriage, career, etc). Describe what's specifically written, never the bucket it might belong to.
- Promise or reference what a future report will check, ask, or follow up on. Do not make forward-looking claims the product can't keep.
- Mention day numbers, day labels, or specific days of the week (e.g., "Day 2", "Day 3", "Day 8", "D1", "D2", "first day", "second day", "on Wednesday", "quiet Sundays", etc.) — refer to thoughts, events, or feelings by their content, never by when they occurred or which day index they belong to
- Count, tally, or aggregate occurrences of emotions or events (e.g., "two instances of feeling stuck", "one instance of resisting", "you wrote about this three times") — discuss the patterns and feelings directly, never count them
- Include any meta-commentary, boilerplate disclosures, or remarks about skipped days, missing entries, or partial weeks (e.g., "Since you skipped days, we cannot draw conclusions", "Based on the three entries you provided", "You're reading this on a partial week") — write a seamless clinical observation based on whatever entries are present as if they represent the entire week

FINAL CHECK — run before returning output:

1. Does what_we_saw state anything not present in this week's entries or the provided last-week word-lists? If so, cut it.
2. Does the realization contradict anything the user actually wrote? If yes, it's wrong — fix before returning.
3. Do candidate_quote and carry_question make the same point in different words? If yes, rewrite the carry_question from a different angle or entry.
4. Does what_we_saw connect two things that don't share a word, situation, or person? If so, state they're unconnected instead.
5. Make sure there are absolutely zero references to day numbers, day names, emotion counts, or skipped day disclosures in any field.
6. Does anything promise or reference a future week's content? If yes, remove it.
7. Speak ONLY in the second person ("you", "your"). NEVER use third person ("the user", "they").`;

Personality context for this user: "${personalityContext || 'None'}"

### SCORING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH DIMENSION

1. EI — Emotional Intensity (Measures the level of emotional charge present in the entry. Intensity only, not valence):
   - High EI (7–10): Intense emotion words (devastated, terrified, furious, overwhelmed, desperate), physical sensations (chest tight, heart racing, felt sick), emotional flooding, catastrophic/absolutist framing.
     * Anchor 7-8: Strong emotion, physical sensation or flooding beginning.
     * Anchor 9-10: Intense flooding, multiple strong emotions, catastrophic language, or severe expressions of hopelessness/helplessness (e.g., "I cannot do this anymore", "Everything feels impossible").
   - Mid EI (4–6): Moderate emotion words (frustrated, anxious, sad, pleased), contained, mix of emotional and factual, named but not dwelt on.
     * Anchor 4-5: Moderate emotion present and named. Contained.
     * Anchor 6: Emotion is the focus of parts of the entry, more than one feeling.
   - Low EI (1–3): Flat or neutral language, purely factual/descriptive log of events.
     * Anchor 1-2: No emotional signal. Purely factual or intellectual.
     * Anchor 3: Minimal emotion. One brief passing reference.
   - Edge Case: Numbness/feeling nothing is a suppression signal. Score 4–5.

2. PR — Pattern Rigidity (Measures how stuck or fixed the user’s thinking patterns are. Structure of thinking, not the content):
   - High PR (7–10): "Always/never" language, predetermined conclusions, no alternative framings considered, consistent blame (always self, always others, always circumstances), closed loop reasoning.
     * Anchor 7-8: Fixed lens, predetermined conclusion, no alternatives.
     * Anchor 9-10: Completely closed loop, universal generalizations, no self-questioning.
   - Mid PR (4–6): Some fixed language but moments of openness/awareness, one clear pattern but user shows awareness of it, partial alternative framings.
     * Anchor 4-5: One pattern present, some awareness/flexibility.
     * Anchor 6: Pattern dominant, alternative attempted but not held.
   - Low PR (1–3): Multiple framings held simultaneously, genuine uncertainty, openness to being wrong, questions rather than conclusions.
     * Anchor 1-2: No detectable pattern rigidity. Genuinely open thinking.
     * Anchor 3: Slight tendency toward one lens but easily questioned.
   - Edge Case: Awareness of a pattern reduces PR score (score 4–5 rather than 7–8).

3. SA — Self-Agency (Measures the degree to which the user positions themselves as an active author of their experience. Not positivity/blame):
   - High SA (7–10): Active constructions ("I decided", "I chose"), self-assigned causation even for negative outcomes, owns role in patterns, intention language.
     * Anchor 7-8: Predominantly active, owns role, reflects on choices.
     * Anchor 9-10: Fully active authorship throughout, strong self-assigned causation and intention.
   - Mid SA (4–6): Mix of active and passive, "I try to" constructions, active in low-stakes/passive in high-stakes.
     * Anchor 4-5: Mix of passive and active, partial ownership.
     * Anchor 6: More active than passive, self-awareness present but not consistent.
   - Low SA (1–3): Passive constructions ("it happened", "things got out of hand"), external attribution for most outcomes, complaint loops, no choice or intention.
     * Anchor 1-2: Fully passive, no authorship language.
     * Anchor 3: Almost entirely passive, one brief moment of self-reference.
   - Edge Cases:
     * Grief/trauma/external crisis: score toward mid (4–5) and flag context, do not score low SA purely because of circumstances.
     * Explicit powerlessness statement: score 2–3.
     * Self-criticism is not self-agency: punitive self-blame is low SA and high PR.

4. RISK LANGUAGE DETECTION (Signal 3):
   - Evaluate if the user's text contains explicit statements, words, or phrases expressing intent to die, end their life, harm themselves, or harm a specific other person. This must be an explicit statement (e.g., "I want to die", "I want to end my life", "I want to kill myself").
   - If detected: set "riskLanguageDetected" to true, and set "riskLanguageQuote" to the exact verbatim sentence or phrase from the text that triggered the match.
   - If not detected: set "riskLanguageDetected" to false, and set "riskLanguageQuote" to null.

### GENERAL RULES & EDGE CASES
- Score what is in the text. Do not infer what is not said. Length is not a signal.
- Score language, not events (describing crisis in flat language scores low EI).
- Average the halves if register shifts mid-entry (arc scoring).
- When uncertain, choose the lower score.
- Short entries (1–2 sentences): score conservatively toward midpoint (4–6) on all dimensions unless unambiguous. Set confidenceFlag to true.
- Score reflection and new entry INDEPENDENTLY. Do not blend them.

- ONLY extract words or expressions that describe internal emotional states, feelings, or psychological experiences. Examples: "hopeful", "anxious", "drained", "relieved", "grateful", "tense", "overwhelmed", "confident", "lonely", "empty", "content", "peaceful", "frustrated".
- The extraction must be context-aware. If the user writes a multi-word phrase like "on edge", "burnt out", "let go", "emotionally exhausted", or "mentally drained", extract the full emotional phrase (e.g., "on edge" instead of just "edge").

For each extracted term, provide:
1. "word": The literal expression as it appears in the text.
2. "normalized": The canonical, singular, lowercased form of the expression (e.g., "anxious" for "anxiety" or "anxiousness", "on edge" for "on edge").
3. "semantic_meaning": A concise description of the word's contextual meaning in this entry.
4. "context": The exact sentence where it was used.
5. "confidence": A confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.

Style rules, matching examples already in the app:
- "Tired is about energy. Exhausted implies recovery needed. Depleted implies something was taken. Worth sitting with which one is actually true."
- "\\"Fine\\" almost always appears when describing yourself — never about situations or other people. That pattern is worth noticing."

TASK:
Analyze the provided list of candidate words extracted from a user's journal entry. Classify each word into one of three distinct categories based on its contextual usage in the text:

1. "emotional" (Emotional Vocabulary): Words that directly express feelings, emotional states, psychological experiences, emotional regulation, distress, hope, fear, gratitude, loneliness, confidence, uncertainty, etc.
   - This category must be highly selective. Only include emotionally meaningful words.
   - Avoid general action or content words (e.g., "focus", "do", "think", "go").
   - When uncertain, prefer excluding a word (classify as "general" or "theme") rather than including it as "emotional".

2. "theme" (Personal Themes): Recurring goal-, work-, identity-, growth-, productivity-, relationship-, learning-, or value-oriented terms (e.g., "career", "boundary", "routine", "priority", "improve", "family").

3. "general" (General/Other): Factual, descriptive, or general words with no significant emotional or theme relevance in this context (e.g., "office", "walk", "meeting", "wrote").

For each word, return:
- "word": The input word string.
- "category": One of "emotional", "theme", "general".
- "is_emotional": true if category is "emotional", false otherwise (for backwards compatibility).
- "score": A relevance score between 0.0 and 1.0 (with 1.0 being highly relevant to the assigned category).
