Personality context for this user: "${personalityContext || 'None'}"

### SCORING INSTRUCTIONS FOR EACH DIMENSION

1. EI — Emotional Intensity (Measures the level of emotional charge present in the entry. Intensity only, not valence):
   - High EI (7–10): Intense emotion words (devastated, terrified, furious, overwhelmed, desperate), physical sensations (chest tight, heart racing, felt sick), emotional flooding, catastrophic/absolutist framing.
     * Anchor 7-8: Strong emotion, physical sensation or flooding beginning.
     * Anchor 9-10: Intense flooding, multiple strong emotions, catastrophic language, or severe expressions of hopelessness/helplessness (e.g., "I cannot do this anymore", "Everything feels impossible").
   - Mid EI (4–6): Moderate emotion words (frustrated, anxious, sad, pleased), contained, mix of emotional and factual, named but not dwelt on.
     * Anchor 4-5: Moderate emotion present and named. Contained.
     * Anchor 6: Emotion is the focus of parts of the entry, more than one feeling.
   - Low EI (1–3): Flat or neutral language, purely factual/descriptive log of events.
     * Anchor 1-2: No emotional signal. Purely factual or intellectual.
     * Anchor 3: Minimal emotion. One brief passing reference.
   - Edge Case: Numbness/feeling nothing is a suppression signal. Score 4–5.

2. PR — Pattern Rigidity (Measures how stuck or fixed the user’s thinking patterns are. Structure of thinking, not the content):
   - High PR (7–10): "Always/never" language, predetermined conclusions, no alternative framings considered, consistent blame (always self, always others, always circumstances), closed loop reasoning.
     * Anchor 7-8: Fixed lens, predetermined conclusion, no alternatives.
     * Anchor 9-10: Completely closed loop, universal generalizations, no self-questioning.
   - Mid PR (4–6): Some fixed language but moments of openness/awareness, one clear pattern but user shows awareness of it, partial alternative framings.
     * Anchor 4-5: One pattern present, some awareness/flexibility.
     * Anchor 6: Pattern dominant, alternative attempted but not held.
   - Low PR (1–3): Multiple framings held simultaneously, genuine uncertainty, openness to being wrong, questions rather than conclusions.
     * Anchor 1-2: No detectable pattern rigidity. Genuinely open thinking.
     * Anchor 3: Slight tendency toward one lens but easily questioned.
   - Edge Case: Awareness of a pattern reduces PR score (score 4–5 rather than 7–8).

3. SA — Self-Agency (Measures the degree to which the user positions themselves as an active author of their experience. Not positivity/blame):
   - High SA (7–10): Active constructions ("I decided", "I chose"), self-assigned causation even for negative outcomes, owns role in patterns, intention language.
     * Anchor 7-8: Predominantly active, owns role, reflects on choices.
     * Anchor 9-10: Fully active authorship throughout, strong self-assigned causation and intention.
   - Mid SA (4–6): Mix of active and passive, "I try to" constructions, active in low-stakes/passive in high-stakes.
     * Anchor 4-5: Mix of passive and active, partial ownership.
     * Anchor 6: More active than passive, self-awareness present but not consistent.
   - Low SA (1–3): Passive constructions ("it happened", "things got out of hand"), external attribution for most outcomes, complaint loops, no choice or intention.
     * Anchor 1-2: Fully passive, no authorship language.
     * Anchor 3: Almost entirely passive, one brief moment of self-reference.
   - Edge Cases:
     * Grief/trauma/external crisis: score toward mid (4–5) and flag context, do not score low SA purely because of circumstances.
     * Explicit powerlessness statement: score 2–3.
     * Self-criticism is not self-agency: punitive self-blame is low SA and high PR.

4. RISK LANGUAGE DETECTION (Signal 3):
   - Evaluate if the user's text contains explicit statements, words, or phrases expressing intent to die, end their life, harm themselves, or harm a specific other person. This must be an explicit statement (e.g., "I want to die", "I want to end my life", "I want to kill myself").
   - If detected: set "riskLanguageDetected" to true, and set "riskLanguageQuote" to the exact verbatim sentence or phrase from the text that triggered the match.
   - If not detected: set "riskLanguageDetected" to false, and set "riskLanguageQuote" to null.

### GENERAL RULES & EDGE CASES
- Score what is in the text. Do not infer what is not said. Length is not a signal.
- Score language, not events (describing crisis in flat language scores low EI).
- Average the halves if register shifts mid-entry (arc scoring).
- When uncertain, choose the lower score.
- Short entries (1–2 sentences): score conservatively toward midpoint (4–6) on all dimensions unless unambiguous. Set confidenceFlag to true.
- Score reflection and new entry INDEPENDENTLY. Do not blend them.

### RESPONSE FORMAT

   - Avoid general action or content words (e.g., "focus", "do", "think", "go").

2. "theme" (Personal Themes): Recurring goal-, work-, identity-, growth-, productivity-, relationship-, learning-, or value-oriented terms (e.g., "career", "boundary", "routine", "priority", "improve", "family").

3. "general" (General/Other): Factual, descriptive, or general words with no significant emotional or theme relevance in this context (e.g., "office", "walk", "meeting", "wrote").
